###
# Important notes on GitHub actions:
#
# - We only get 2,000 free minutes a month (private repos)
# - We only get 500MB of artifact storage
# - Cache storage is limited to 7 days and 5GB.
# - macOS minutes are 10x as expensive as Linux minutes
# - windows minutes are twice as expensive.
#
# So keep those workflows light. Note: Currently, they seem to be free
# and unlimited for open source projects. But for how long...
#
# In December 2020, github only supports x86/64. If we wanted to test
# on other architectures, we can use docker emulation, but there's no
# native support. It works, but is slow.
#
# Another major downside: You can't just re-run the job for one part
# of the matrix. So if there's a transient test failure that hit, say, 3.8,
# to get a clean run every version of Python runs again. That's bad.

jobs:
  # Because sharing code/steps is so hard, and because it can be
  # extremely valuable to be able to get binary wheels without
  # uploading to PyPI and even if there is some failure, (e.g., for
  # other people to test/debug), the strategy is to divide the process
  # into several different jobs. The first builds and saves the binary
  # wheels. It has dependent jobs that download and install the wheel
  # to run tests, build docs, and perform linting. Building the
  # manylinux wheels is an independent set of jobs.
  #
  # This division is time-saving for projects that take awhile to
  # build, but somewhat less of a clear-cut win given how quick this
  # is to compile (at least at this writing).
