==================
3.6.0 (2010-04-29)
==================

- LP #185974:  Clear the cache used by ``Specificaton.get`` inside
  ``Specification.changed``.  Thanks to Jacob Holm for the patch.

- Added support for Python 3.1. Contributors:
    Lennart Regebro
    Martin v Löwis
    Thomas Lotze
    Wolfgang Schnerring

  The 3.1 support is completely backwards compatible. However, the implements
  syntax used under Python 2.X does not work under 3.X, since it depends on
  how metaclasses are implemented and this has changed. Instead it now supports
  a decorator syntax (also under Python 2.X):

    class Foo:
        implements(IFoo)
        ...

  can now also be written

    @implementor(IFoo):
    class Foo:
        ...

  There are 2to3 fixers available to do this change automatically in the
  zope.fixers package.

- Python 2.3 is no longer supported.


==================
3.5.4 (2009-12-23)
==================

- Use the standard Python doctest module instead of zope.testing.doctest, which
  has been deprecated.


==================
3.5.3 (2009-12-08)
==================

- Fix an edge case: make providedBy() work when a class has '__provides__' in
  its __slots__ (see http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.web.zope.devel/22490)


==================
3.5.2 (2009-07-01)
==================

- BaseAdapterRegistry.unregister, unsubscribe: Remove empty portions of
  the data structures when something is removed.  This avoids leaving
  references to global objects (interfaces) that may be slated for
  removal from the calling application.


==================
3.5.1 (2009-03-18)
==================

- verifyObject: use getattr instead of hasattr to test for object attributes
  in order to let exceptions other than AttributeError raised by properties
  propagate to the caller

- Add Sphinx-based documentation building to the package buildout
  configuration. Use the ``bin/docs`` command after buildout.

- Improve package description a bit. Unify changelog entries formatting.

- Change package's mailing list address to zope-dev at zope.org as
  zope3-dev at zope.org is now retired.


==================
3.5.0 (2008-10-26)
==================

- Fixed declaration of _zope_interface_coptimizations, it's not a top level
  package.

- Add a DocTestSuite for odd.py module, so their tests are run.

- Allow to bootstrap on Jython.

- Fix https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope3/3.3/+bug/98388: ISpecification
  was missing a declaration for __iro__.

- Added optional code optimizations support, which allows the building
  of C code optimizations to fail (Jython).

- Replaced `_flatten` with a non-recursive implementation, effectively making
  it 3x faster.


==================
3.4.1 (2007-10-02)
==================

- Fixed a setup bug that prevented installation from source on systems
  without setuptools.


==================
3.4.0 (2007-07-19)
==================

- Final release for 3.4.0.


====================
3.4.0b3 (2007-05-22)
====================


- Objects with picky custom comparison methods couldn't be added to
  component registries.  Now, when checking whether an object is
  already registered, identity comparison is used.


====================
3.3.0.1 (2007-01-03)
====================

- Made a reference to OverflowWarning, which disappeared in Python
  2.5, conditional.


==================
3.3.0 (2007/01/03)
==================

New Features
============

- The adapter-lookup algorithim was refactored to make it
  much simpler and faster.  

  Also, more of the adapter-lookup logic is implemented in C, making
  debugging of application code easier, since there is less
  infrastructre code to step through.

- We now treat objects without interface declarations as if they
  declared that they provide zope.interface.Interface.

- There are a number of richer new adapter-registration interfaces
  that provide greater control and introspection.

- Added a new interface decorator to zope.interface that allows the
  setting of tagged values on an interface at definition time (see
  zope.interface.taggedValue).

Bug Fixes
=========

- A bug in multi-adapter lookup sometimes caused incorrect adapters to
  be returned.


====================
3.2.0.2 (2006-04-15)
====================

- Fix packaging bug:  'package_dir' must be a *relative* path.


====================
3.2.0.1 (2006-04-14)
====================

- Packaging change:  suppress inclusion of 'setup.cfg' in 'sdist' builds.


==================
3.2.0 (2006-01-05)
==================

- Corresponds to the verison of the zope.interface package shipped as part of
  the Zope 3.2.0 release.


==================
3.1.0 (2005-10-03)
==================

- Corresponds to the verison of the zope.interface package shipped as part of
  the Zope 3.1.0 release.

- Made attribute resolution order consistent with component lookup order,
  i.e. new-style class MRO semantics.

- Deprecated 'isImplementedBy' and 'isImplementedByInstancesOf' APIs in
  favor of 'implementedBy' and 'providedBy'.


==================
3.0.1 (2005-07-27)
==================

- Corresponds to the verison of the zope.interface package shipped as part of
  the Zope X3.0.1 release.

- Fixed a bug reported by James Knight, which caused adapter registries
  to fail occasionally to reflect declaration changes.


==================
3.0.0 (2004-11-07)
==================

- Corresponds to the verison of the zope.interface package shipped as part of
  the Zope X3.0.0 release.
